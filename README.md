Quick guessing game so I could practice using promises

## Quick Look

- Promises (try/catch)
- JS and HTML

## What I learned

Thanks to some help from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J29jeuyMJ38&t=1s" target="_blank">awesome tutorial</a> by Thu Nghiem I was able to fill some of the cracks in the foundation of my <code>Promise</code> and <code>async/await</code> knowledge. I coded the number guessing game that he teaches viewers to build then added a few UX functions of my own. This was a great way to wrap my head around promises.
